Participants: Sonia, Rahul, Grace
Department: Executive
Meeting Type: Strategy Session

Sonia: Good afternoon. We’re here to finalize our strategy for Reach’s June launch. First, Rahul, status on product readiness?
Rahul: Engineering reports we’re on track. Beta tests in April will focus on core social features—posting, commenting, groups. All critical bugs must be addressed before May 15.
Grace: Marketing needs that May 15 freeze to build ad campaigns. We have $500K budget allocated across digital, outdoor, and PR.
Sonia: Understood. On PR, I’ve scheduled interviews with TechCrunch and Mashable for mid-May. Grace, coordinate messaging?
Grace: Yes. Our narrative: Reach empowers authentic connections, safe spaces, with unique interest-based communities. I’ll craft the talking points.
Rahul: Legal flagged potential GDPR compliance gaps. We need data processing agreements in place before EU beta.
Sonia: I spoke with legal—contracts team will have draft by next Tuesday. Rahul, review and integrate.
Rahul: Will do. Next, risk assessment: what keeps us up at night?
Grace: Influencer fatigue—users might see sponsored content as inauthentic. We need genuine testimonials.
Sonia: Let’s recruit real beta users for video testimonials. Authenticity over scale.
Grace: Agreed. Also, support staffing—we have only 5 CSR reps for expected launch volume.
Rahul: We can automate initial triage with chatbots for common issues.
Sonia: Good. Budget for chatbot integration?
Grace: $50K line item. ROI positive if we deflect 30% inquiries.
Rahul: And post-launch metrics—what KPIs?
Grace: DAU, WAU, acquisition cost, user retention rate at 7 days, net promoter score.
Sonia: Solid. On fundraising, board expects update on demo performance by May 1.
Rahul: We’ll have analytics ready. Data engineering to prep dashboards.
Grace: Graphics team building investor deck; slides due April 20.
Sonia: Lastly, partnership pipeline—chat with Spotify for music-based communities next week.
(Phone rings; Sonia silences)
Sonia: That’s the gist. Align on tasks, meet again Monday. Thanks everyone.
