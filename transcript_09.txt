Participants: Olivia, Daniel, Grace, Sophie
Department: HR
Meeting Type: Staffing & Training

Olivia: Welcome to our HR staffing and training sync. First, headcount updates. Daniel?
Daniel: We’ve onboarded 3 CSR reps last week and 2 community managers. Total support headcount is now 12.
Grace: Good. Training status?
Sophie: New hires completed Reach 101 and Compliance training. However, 30% failed the post-training quiz on data privacy protocols.
Olivia: That’s concerning. We need to remediate quickly. Sophie, schedule one-on-one review sessions.
Sophie: Will do. Also, we have 4 pending offer acceptances for marketing and analytics roles.
Daniel: Marketing candidate pool is strong; analytics pipeline is shallow. We need more active sourcing.
Olivia: Let’s engage our recruiting agency more aggressively or attend the TechHiring Expo next month.
Grace: Soft skills training feedback?
Sophie: Teams appreciate the communication workshops, but want more practical exercises- role-playing real support scenarios.
Daniel: We can integrate scenario-based drills for invite feature issues.
Olivia: Good idea. Schedule those in April’s training calendar.
(Phone vibrate; group pauses briefly)
Olivia: Any diversity initiatives?
Grace: Partnered with Women in Tech for a speaker series next week.
Sophie: Also rolling out mentorship circles-5 mentors and 10 mentees matched.
Olivia: Excellent. Finally, performance review timeline for Q1?
Daniel: Starting April 1. New review form includes growth potential and cultural impact sections.
Grace: Managers need training on new form.
Sophie: I’ll prepare a manager workshop.
Olivia: Perfect. Let’s reconvene next Monday. Thanks!
