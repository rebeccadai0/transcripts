Participants: Alex, Jasmine, Priya, Leo
Department: Marketing
Meeting Type: Brainstorm

Alex: Good morning, everyone. Let’s get started on today’s brainstorm for Reach’s launch. First up, our tagline. Jasmine, what did you have?
Jasmine: I’ve been testing "Stay connected, effortlessly" with our user focus group. The feedback was polite but lukewarm. They said it didn’t capture the energy of Reach’s community vibe.
Leo: I agree. It feels generic—like a productivity app, not a social network. We need something punchy, something that reflects belonging or discovery.
Priya: How about “Discover Your Circle”? But then it sounds like a niche mapping tool.
Jasmine: Maybe something around "Your world, made social"? It hints at amplification.
Alex: I like the intent, but “made social” might be grammatically clunky. What about “Your world, made for sharing”?
Leo: That has promise, but “sharing” is overused. Let’s explore synonyms: connect, unite, link — none have that spark. We need a verb that evokes excitement.
Priya: What about “Ignite Connections”? It’s dynamic.
Alex: Ooh, “Ignite” brings fire, which could be good for a launch. But are we okay with that fiery imagery? Could be too aggressive.
Jasmine: True. Maybe “Spark Connections”? A bit softer.
Leo: I like “Spark Connections.” It’s both aspirational and actionable.
Priya: Agreed. Let’s park that as our front-runner for tagline testing.

(Brief pause while Jasmine sips coffee)

Leo: Next: influencer and community strategy. We identified ten mid-tier creators in lifestyle and tech niches. Our budget allows for three partnerships initially.
Alex: Right. I recommend we stagger the influencer posts—one per week in April, building to launch. That keeps momentum.
Jasmine: We also need cohesive assets—short-form video, static posts, stories. Design team, any word on production timelines?
Priya: Design said they can supply initial reels and static graphics by March 15. Is that feasible, Leo?
Leo: Yes, assuming no major revisions. Let’s allocate buffer for two rounds of feedback.
Alex: Good. Jasmine, draft the partnership briefs and outreach emails. Let’s track responses in the shared sheet.
Jasmine: On it. I’ll have drafts by tomorrow morning.

(Leo’s phone buzzes; he glances and shakes head)

Leo: Sorry, spam. Moving on: campaign landing page wireframe. We need conversion-focused copy and visuals that emphasize community features—user stories, groups, private messaging.
Priya: I suggest we include a “beta tester” signup form above the fold. That gives us early feedback and builds hype.
Alex: I love that. Let’s define metrics: target 5,000 signups by April 30. Jasmine, add that as a KPI.
Jasmine: Done. Also, the coffee machine broke—P1 support says a part’s coming tomorrow.
Leo: Terrible timing. I’m running low on caffeine. We need to bring donuts next time.
Priya: Definitely donuts. I’ll take notes: donuts for next meeting.

Alex: Perfect. That wraps up our brainstorm. Action items: finalize tagline test, drafts for influencer outreach, design briefs for assets, landing page KPIs. Thanks, team!
