Participants: Mike, Sofia, Lian, Ravi, Emma
Department: Product
Meeting Type: Weekly Standup

Mike: Good morning team, let’s dive in. Last week we deployed the initial notification service update, but we’ve seen persistent latency issues. Sofia, can you walk us through what you observed?
Sofia: Sure. I was monitoring production logs after the 9:00 AM spike yesterday, and I noticed the notification queue backed up for about 12 minutes. End users experienced delays ranging from 8 to 15 seconds, which is above our 2-second goal.
Lian: Right, and I’ve checked the batching logic. It’s grouping notifications in sets of 100 by default, and when the load is high, it creates a bottleneck. The downstream service can’t process that many at once.
Ravi: That matches my initial analysis. My plan is to switch to dynamic batching—smaller groups when queue length exceeds threshold X. I’ll implement an adaptive strategy by the end of today.
Emma: As we refine batching, don’t forget accessibility. In our last round of screen-reader tests, we got feedback that the notification announcements weren’t being properly labeled, so VoiceOver reads ‘Alert from system’ instead of ‘New comment on your Reach post.’
Sofia: I’ve already filed a ticket to add the aria-label attribute dynamically based on notification content. I’ll prioritize that after you finalize the batching update.
Mike: Perfect. Emma, can you confirm we still aim for a deploy window tomorrow morning?
Emma: Yes—assuming Ravi’s code review is complete. We should run accessibility smoke tests in staging this afternoon.

Mike: Sounds good. Quick check—any progress on profile image caching issues?
Ravi: Yes, I instrumented the CDN headers. They were set to cache for 5 minutes instead of 30. I’ve pushed a patch to extend TTL. Rate limiting should be less frequent now.
Lian: Awesome. Also, I’m reviewing the new A/B test metrics to measure click-through on the “Invite Friends” prompt. Preliminary data looks promising—10% lift so far.
Mike: Great work. On a non-technical note, remember our team lunch tomorrow—Asian fusion place down the street. My treat!
Emma: Can’t wait.
Sofia: Count me in.
Ravi: See you there.
Lian: Thanks, Mike.
