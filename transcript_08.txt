Date: March 15, 2025
Participants: Liam, Ava, Noah, Zoe
Department: Security
Meeting Type: Compliance Checkpoint

Liam: Greetings, team. Today’s compliance checkpoint focuses on Reach’s data privacy and security posture. Ava?
Ava: We completed internal pentest last week. Discovered two medium-severity issues: insecure direct object references in media uploads, and JWT tokens not rotated on logout.
Noah: Should be straightforward to fix. For IDOR, we need object-level authorization checks. I’ve drafted a patch in PR #58.
Zoe: Regarding JWT, we need to implement token blacklisting or short-lived tokens with refresh. I recommend refresh tokens valid for 15 minutes and rotating on every access.
Liam: Good plan. Also, EU GDPR controls- have we updated our consent flow?
Ava: Partially. The cookie banner collects explicit consent, but the “privacy settings” page lacks granular controls for data sharing.
Noah: We need toggles for data processing categories: analytics, personalization, third-party sharing.
Zoe: I’ll update the UI spec and work with front-end to integrate.
Liam: On encryption, database backups are currently unencrypted in transit to our S3 bucket.
Ava: AWS supports server-side encryption. We should enable SSE-S3 immediately.
Noah: And enforce TLS 1.2+ for all connections.
Zoe: Already patched staging environment; production rollout tomorrow.
(Background noise: keyboard clatter)
Liam: Next: incident response plan. We need to finalize roles for breach notifications.
Ava: We have a draft: CTO to coordinate technical response, legal for notifications, PR for public statements, support for user inquiries.
Noah: Let’s table response timelines: notifications within 72 hours per GDPR, but aim for 24 hours internally.
Zoe: Agree. Also drafting communication templates.
Liam: Good. Lastly, third-party risk: we use CDNs and email vendors. We need vendor SOC2 Type II reports.
Ava: Collected from Cloudflare and SendGrid; under review.
Noah: Next audit due June 1.
Liam: Perfect. That’s all. Keep us posted on PR status. Meeting adjourned.
